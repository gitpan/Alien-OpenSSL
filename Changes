Changes for Alien::OpenSSL

* 0.05
- do not install doc, this lead to problems on some systems. Thanks, plicease

* 0.04
- remove workarounds for Alien::Base pre 0.03 and make work with
  current OpenSSL versions

* 0.03
- only install software and skip docs. Is faster and prevents problems.

* 0.02
- also build shared library (it is not really of much use without them...)

* 0.01
- initial version
